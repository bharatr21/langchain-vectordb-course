# LangChain and Vector Databases in Production 
## ActiveLoop, Towards AI and the Intel Disruptor Initiative
This contains most of the material from ActiveLoop's Course on LangChain and Vector Databases in Production: https://learn.activeloop.ai/courses/langchain

## Authentication/API Keys
While going through the course, I created a `keys.py` file in the same directory and within the file, 
constants were set as follows:

```python
OPENAI_API_KEY = '<Your OpenAI API Key>'
ACTIVELOOP_TOKEN = '<Your ActiveLoop Token>'
GOOGLE_API_KEY = '<Your Google API Key>'
GOOGLE_CSE_ID = '<Your Google App ID>'
HUGGINGFACEHUB_API_TOKEN = '<Your HuggingFace Token>'
ELEVEN_API_KEY = '<Your ElevenLabs API Key>'
```
Other API keys may also be required while going through the course.
